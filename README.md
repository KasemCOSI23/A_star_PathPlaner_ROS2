# Implementation of Path planning algorithms (A* and Dijkstra) in ROS2
Worked with a group of three COSI students to implement A* and Dijkstra path planning algorithms for a robot using ROS2.

1. **A* Algorithm Implementation:**
 ```bash
Developed and tested the A* algorithm for pathfinding in a dynamic environment.
Converted real-world coordinates to grid-based cost map coordinates for path calculations.
Implemented a priority queue using cumulative costs and a heuristic for navigation.
 ```bash

Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation:

Implemented the Dijkstra algorithm to compare performance with A*.
Focused on cumulative costs for navigation without heuristics, suitable for short distances.
Faced challenges with long-distance targets, including frequent recoveries and goal-abort scenarios.
